    Meausures the evenness of the distribution of precipitation over months.
    Larger values means precipitation is more concentrated in the wet season.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    vector: ndarray
        12-element vector corresponding to a 12-month climatology.
    norm_frac: float
        whether to normalize the annual total by the global maximum in order to
        distinguish between different locations across the world
        (norm_frac = 7932 mm yr^{-1} at Tabubil, Papua New Guinea in the original paper).
