# collected_templates

This collection contains templates of standard analysis of global climate data. Such analysis tend to have similar code structure across datasets, but cannot be easily standardized in functions because they need many customizations for variable names, resolutions, plotting requirements etc. Therefore, I make these templates for copy-paste-modifying purpose, to reduce coding trouble.
